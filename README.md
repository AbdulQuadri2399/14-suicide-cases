# WHO Suicide Statistics
*Analyse the number of suicide cases based on country, year, demography and age group*

**Content**

Basic aggregate numbers covering 1979-2016, by country, year, age groups and sex. There is only one file, with only a few columns. I made this file using the WHO Mortality Database online tool.
